# SPARCK Two

SPatial Augmented Reality Contruction Kit 2.

Also includes QueScript.

There are three flavors of SPARCK:

* The standalone app.
* Running the app inside Max8. You need [Max8](https://cycling74.com/downloads/) and the SPARCK package, but there is no need for a Max8 license.
* The SPARCK package for creating [Max](https://cycling74.com/downloads/) patches based on SPARCK nodes. This allows to use the full power of Max8 in combination with SPARCK. This requires a [Max8 license](https://cycling74.com/shop).

## Installation
